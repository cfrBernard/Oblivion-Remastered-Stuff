# 🛠️ Oblivion Remastered – Modding Toolkit Repository

Welcome to my personal development environment for modding **Oblivion Remastered (2025)**.  
This repository centralizes everything I’m building, tweaking, or referencing while exploring the modding capabilities of the new UE5 remaster.

> 🧪 Early-stage! The game has just released (April 2025), and official tools are **not yet updated** to support it natively.  
> Many workflows here rely on clever workarounds and may evolve over time.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `Safe Environment/`

> ⚠️ [Read the full setup guide here →](/Safe%20Environment)

A sandboxed folder that replicates an Oblivion install structure.  
It lets you run tools like **TES4Edit** or **TESCS** on your `.esm` and `.esp` without messing with your actual game.

Contains:
- `.bat` setup script
- Dummy `Oblivion.exe`
- `README.md` with full instructions

---

### `Mods/`

Custom mods I'm creating or experimenting with.

- WIP mods
- Simple tweaks (e.g. message replacement)
- Utility plugins

Each mod folder contains its own setup notes and plugin files.

---

### `Docs/`

Research, notes, discoveries, and tool experiments.

- File format breakdowns
- Tool compatibility tests
- Modding tips and technical breakdowns

---

### `Resources/`

External or bundled resources that assist with modding.

- Extracted BSA files
- Sample ESPs
- ReShade presets
- Icon packs, scripts, etc.
